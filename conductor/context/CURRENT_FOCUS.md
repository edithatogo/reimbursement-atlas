# Current focus

The repo is now in the reviewed-source preparation and mapping-workbench phase. v9 adds optional-toolchain probes, manual acquisition-pack generation, deterministic mapping evidence and vector seed exports.

## Immediate focus

1. Keep all public artefacts dashboard-safe and licence-safe.
2. Validate manually downloaded live sources only through `data/raw_live/` plus snapshot metadata and derived-only outputs.
3. Use the manual acquisition pack to guide the first real MBS July 2026 TXT-pair parse.
4. Treat mapping evidence and vector search outputs as review queues, not equivalence statements.
5. Keep CLI/API/MCP surfaces read-only until acquisition and licence controls are mature.
6. Keep quality gates green: Ruff, basedpyright, Bandit, compileall, uv build, >90% coverage, npm audit and Astro build.
7. Record optional toolchain status honestly; Mojo is available via uv tool, while official Pixi may be blocked by container DNS or missing.

## Next agent handoff

Start with `docs/MANUAL_ACQUISITION_PACK.md`, `docs/MAPPING_WORKBENCH.md`, `docs/OPTIONAL_TOOLCHAIN_INSTALLS.md`, `docs/LIVE_SOURCE_VALIDATION_PLAYBOOK.md`, `docs/MBS_TXT_PAIR_PARSER.md`, and `conductor/sessions/2026-07-04-v9-toolchain-and-mapping-workbench.md`.

Immediate next step: manually download the July 2026 MBS item-map and descriptor TXT files, place them in `data/raw_live/au_mbs/`, snapshot them, parse with `parse-mbs-txt-pair`, and commit only derived rows and provenance metadata.
